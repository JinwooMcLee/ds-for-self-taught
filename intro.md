# Data Science for The (Brave and) Self-Taught

Data Science is such a wide area that it's hard for beginners to figure out where to start. As a self-taught data scientist, I also did struggle the same.

**What you can get after reading this book are**
* What to learn step-by-step to become a data scientist or analyst
* What data science jobs there are on the market, and choose which to pursue
* How to land your first job

**What you won't get after reading this book are**
* What to learn to become a data engineer (*I haven't worked as data engineer, so I cannot help you with that*)
* All the knowledges needed for data scientist or analyst (*But I can indicate you good resources*)
